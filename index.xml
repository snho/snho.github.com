      <description>ShareX - my preferred screenshot tool for Windows.
I&amp;rsquo;m OS agnostic, but one of the programs I wish I had on all the computers I use would be ShareX. Years ago, ShareX originally for me was a more powerful replacement to the stock snipping tool on Windows, and something that I could get close to the built in screen capture tools on macOS through hotkeys. It has since surpassed being just my screenshot program, as it does so much more!</description>

      <description>3D printed spool of wire.
This is a customisable spool that I designed in OpenSCAD. You should be able to customise most aspects of the spool to fit your spooling needs. I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded it to Thingiverse and it&amp;rsquo;s also available on my Github repo
Originally I designed a non-customisable spool to share some solder wire for a friend, but quickly figured out this would be a good opportunity to design a customisable part that I could use to organise/share other items in my workshop such as cables, rope, foam tapes, and thread.</description>

      <description>Personal Commissioning/Go Bag
The last few jobs I did had me travel a fair bit, and as part of those trips I did lots of commissioning and installation work of low voltage and standalone electrical equipment (solar/battery) without work, or the site/client providing the tools. Due to the nature of some of the places I was travelling (MEA and SEA primarily), you really couldn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee what would be available on-site.</description>

      <title>Trying Out Hugo</title>

      <description>This blog is using Hugo. It was pretty quick and easy to setup. My only previous static site generator experience was Jekyll.
It is currently using the Tanka theme. This is subject to change as I dive deeper and will either modify it (likely) or switch it up completely.
Hugo was selected because:
 Static sites are the fastest. Static means I can just host it for free on Github Pages - turns out blogging isn&amp;rsquo;t just limited to Jekyll.</description>
