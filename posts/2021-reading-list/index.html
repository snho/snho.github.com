<p>These are some of my favourite books I&rsquo;ve read and completed in 2021. They&rsquo;re not in any particular rank.</p>
<h3 id="project-hail-mary">Project Hail Mary</h3>
<p><em>by Andy Weir</em></p>
<p>A must read if you were a fan of <em>The Martian</em> like I was. I was left a little disappointed with
Andy Weir&rsquo;s second novel, <em>Artemis</em>, but lightning (thankfully!) strikes twice with <em>Project Hail Mary</em>. The scientific exposition is digestible for a layman, but maybe not fully as in-depth as some might wanted as I&rsquo;ve heard from some friends that have shared their thoughts with me. Overall though, this was another page turner that I ended up finishing over a weekend as I couldn&rsquo;t put it down.
I would still put <em>The Martian</em> above it (and especially since the film is fantastic as well), but if <em>Artemis</em> fell short for you (if you could complete it!), then <em>Project Hail Mary</em> is definitely worth a read if you enjoy Weir&rsquo;s first novel. The audiobook is good too if you prefer that format. Less accents than <em>The Martian</em> however!</p>

<h3 id="iron-coffins-a-personal-account-of-the-german-u-boat-battles-of-world-war-ii">Iron Coffins: A Personal Account of the German U-boat Battles of World War II</h3>
<p><em>by Herbert A. Werner</em></p>
<p>I had a bit of a year where I had a resurgence in my interest in submarines. Mostly because one of my favourites websites is <a href="http://www.hisutton.com/">Covert Shores</a> which I check way to regularly. I particularly enjoy Sutton&rsquo;s OSINT articles, as well as the cutaway illustrations that remind me of the books I loved growing up. They&rsquo;re also all done in MS Paint!!!!! (And Gimp) Checkout the video if you don&rsquo;t believe me!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Anyway, back on course, <em>Iron Coffins</em> is a fantastic memoir from a German U-boat captain who survived WWII. The writing is fantastic and immersive, making you feel part of the initial triumphs of the U-boat fleet to the decimation of the U-boat crews when anti-sub warfare, and the overall momentum of the war shifted. A memoir that poignantly reminds us how utter futile and wasteful war is. A rare incredible story from &ldquo;the other side&rdquo; - I&rsquo;m definitely collating a list of more German memoirs as this was so well written. My favourite moment in the book was a not so subtle reminder of how small the world can be told through a post-war experience from Werner. Another book I couldn&rsquo;t put down (I wish it was longer!) that I finished in just over a weekend.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="the-order-of-time">The Order of Time</h3>
<p><em>by Carlo Rovelli</em></p>
<p>This is my first introduction to Rovelli&rsquo;s writing. I picked this up based on some recommendations from some friends. It' a short exploration of &ldquo;time&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s a beautifully written thought provoking piece that has made me reconsider how I think of time. Absolutely quotable in many parts, I&rsquo;m not sure digesting it via an audiobook would be recommended (it is narrated by Benedict Cumberbatch though!). I definitely had moments where I simply had to pause to digest what I had read. You don&rsquo;t need a degree in physics or quantum mechanics to enjoy this book!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="horus-rising">Horus Rising</h3>
<p><em>by Dan Abnett</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently started to get back into 40K. Mostly been fuelled by the dropping prices of resin printers and an urge to get into miniatures and models I&rsquo;ve had since my formative years. I played a few of the RTS games growing up and was somewhat familiar with the extensive lore, and was aware of the rich library of 40K novels. However, I had no idea where to start. Luckily I was recommended by a friend to checkout <a href="http://www.kylebb.com/HH/HHSeriesOrder.html">this helpful guide</a>.</p>
<p>I promptly loaded my Kindle with the first few novels recommended, and have been enjoying them as page turners for my commute to mix it up once in awhile from the other books I&rsquo;ve been reading throughout the year. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it so far, but we will see how far I continue in 2022. I feel like I will drop it at some point, but will likely find an urge prior to a game release or want to dive more into the lore beyond the wiki.</p>
<p>Also the Astartes shorts help a wee bit too&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="atlas-obscura-2nd-edition">Atlas Obscura (2nd Edition)</h3>
<p><em>by Joshua Foer, Dylan Thuras, Ella Morton</em></p>
<p>This is more of a coffee table book. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/">Atlas Obscura</a>, it is an online catalogue of unusual and obscure travel destinations. It&rsquo;s one of my favourite sites on the web. and one of my goto resources when I&rsquo;m in search of some unique or unexpected places to visit when I&rsquo;m in country or planning for a trip abroad. I was gifted this copy, and it&rsquo;s a nice changeup to my coffee table books which are normally &ldquo;The art of&hellip;&rdquo; or behind the scenes books.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice book to flip through, but it obviously doesn&rsquo;t replace the website. A nice gift for those planning a more adventurous 2022!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="leviathan-falls">Leviathan Falls</h3>
<p><em>by James S.A. Corey</em></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s over! Luckily I didn&rsquo;t have to wait too long, as I was a bit late to starting this epic space opera as I only picked it up a couple years ago whilst waiting between the TV seasons. The ending was satisfying yet bittersweet, an exciting conclusion to my favourite space opera series. It&rsquo;s become a beloved series, and I hope there is more in this universe in the future. The Amazon series has concluded as well (it doesn&rsquo;t cover all the novels), so there will be a giant hole for a while - hopefully a spin-off series or novel soon! I&rsquo;m glad the ending was nailed, it could have spoiled it all. An incredible series - if you haven&rsquo;t read it, give it a go and start with <em>Leviathan Wakes</em>&hellip; I know some folks who haven&rsquo;t read since high-school have picked up reading it just based on how good the TV show is!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="2021-rereads"><strong>2021 Rereads</strong></h2>
<p>I particularly enjoy rereading books. It&rsquo;s primarily why I enjoy having hard copies of them and why it took me so long to finally get a kindle. I keep track of how many times I&rsquo;ve read a book by simply tracking my start and end dates, kind of like the check-in and out stamps on a library book.</p>
<h3 id="blind-mans-bluff">Blind Mans Bluff</h3>
<p><em>by Sherry Sontag, Christopher Drew, Annette Lawrence Drew</em></p>
<p>Another one of the sub books I read in 2021, but this time a reread. You could read this book thinking that it was just some fictional techno/war/spy thriller, except it isn&rsquo;t - and to be brutally honest, far more interesting! It was absolutely fascinating to remind myself of the development of covert ops/espionage submarines from as early as just after WWII to the 70s.
Absolutely packed with incredible stories that I enjoyed rereading such as the insane lengths the US/CIA went with the Glomar Explorer, tailing Russian submarines just a few yards away in the endless cat and mouse games of the early Cold War, to details of the tapping of undersea cables and efforts to recover parts from missile tests. A rare glimpse into the clandestine operations of the silent service.</p>
<h3 id="dune">Dune</h3>
<p><em>by Frank Herbert</em></p>
<p>I just had to reread this before the release of the film. I&rsquo;m glad I did as I hadn&rsquo;t read it since I first read it over a decade ago. The recent film (the first part at least) is fantastic as well. High recommend reading it if you&rsquo;ve seen the recent film, but have never read the books (I&rsquo;d probably stop around the 3rd book however!).</p>
