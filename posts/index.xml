      <description>Personal Commissioning/Go Bag
 The last few jobs I did had me travel a fair bit, and as part of those trips I did lots of commissioning/installation work of low voltage and standalone electrical equipment without work covering for the tools. Due to the nature of some of the places I was travelling (MEA and SEA primarily), you really couldn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee what would be available on-site. As an example, one of the sites I visited in the Middle-East only had a single (corded) power drill on site, shared by at least dozen workers!</description>

      <description>This blog is using Hugo. It was pretty quick and easy to setup. My only previous static site generator experience was Jekyll.
It is currently using the Tanka theme. This is subject to change as I dive deeper and will either modify it (likely) or switch it up completely.
Hugo was selected because:
 Static sites are the fastest. Static means I can just host it for free on Github Pages - turns out blogging isn&amp;rsquo;t just limited to Jekyll.</description>
