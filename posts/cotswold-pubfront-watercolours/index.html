<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Over the initial lockdowns in 2020, I started to get into watercolour paintings. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the look of watercolour paintings for as long as I can remember, and I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed the difficulty of them and how the process is quite different to other painting mediums. The difference being how it&rsquo;s an additive process in that you go from light to dark traditional and due to the less opaque nature of the paints, it&rsquo;s easier to mess up and hard to undo. Unlike acrylics and oils, you can pretty much go over your mistakes.</p>
<p>This different approach, mixed with the difficulty, and also the fact that I can&rsquo;t really undo my mistakes as easily as the other mediums (or with digital art), was a real draw to me. It&rsquo;s the opposite in how I normally operate, thus it was the perfect medium to get me to slow down and not rush things.</p>

<p>The first series of paintings I complete was a collection of pub fronts. The series is mostly inspired with the Tokyo Storefronts series by .

<h2 id="paintings">Paintings</h2>
<p>The following are some of the painting I painted. The process is described in the following section, but it mostly follows in the same process of the previously mentioned artists. I&rsquo;ve also listed the materials and tools I used.</p>
